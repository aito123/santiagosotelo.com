In this post I will explore the labour participation of men and women in South America between 1990 and 2021. For this, I have used the "Labour Force Participation Rate" database of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/labour-force-participation-rate) This database considers the labour force from the age of 15 and older.

```{r}
df_male <- read_csv(here("Labour Force Participation Rate - Male.csv"))
df_female <- read_csv(here("Labour Force Participation Rate - Female.csv"))

#Labour force participation rate, female (% ages 15 and older)
df <- bind_rows(
  df_male %>% rename_with(~gsub("Labour force participation rate, male (% ages 15 and older) ", "lfpr_", .x, fixed = T), starts_with("Labour")) %>% mutate(gender = "Male", .before = starts_with("lfpr")),
  df_female %>% rename_with(~gsub("Labour force participation rate, female (% ages 15 and older) ", "lfpr_", .x, fixed = T), starts_with("Labour")) %>% mutate(gender = "Female", .before = starts_with("lfpr"))
) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 7:38,
               names_to = c(NA, "year"),
               names_sep = "\\_"
               ) %>% 
  # Getting South America
  mutate(
    continent = case_when(
      country %in% c("Argentina", "Bolivia", "Brazil", "Chile", "Colombia", 
                     "Ecuador", "Guyana", "Paraguay", "Peru", "Suriname",
                     "Uruguay", "Venezuela") ~ "South America",
      .default = continent
    )
  ) %>% 
  # arrange(gender, year, continent, desc(value)) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(-value) * 1.0, .by = c(gender, year, continent))

df_sa_male <- 
  df %>% 
  filter(continent %in% "South America" & gender %in% "Male") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  complete(year = full_seq(year, .5)) %>%
  mutate(value = spline(x = year, y = value, xout = year)$y) %>% #manya años intermedios
  # "approx" below for linear interpolation. "spline" has a bouncy effect.
  mutate(rank = approx(x = year, y = rank,      xout = year)$y) %>% #manya ranking intermedio1
  ungroup()  %>% 
  arrange(country,year)

df_sa_female <- 
  df %>% 
  filter(continent %in% "South America" & gender %in% "Female") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  complete(year = full_seq(year, .5)) %>%
  mutate(value = spline(x = year, y = value, xout = year)$y) %>% #manya años intermedios
  # "approx" below for linear interpolation. "spline" has a bouncy effect.
  mutate(rank = approx(x = year, y = rank,      xout = year)$y) %>% #manya ranking intermedio1
  ungroup()  %>% 
  arrange(country,year)

```

## Male labour force participation in South America

```{r}
#| eval: false

p_male <- 
  df_sa_male %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rank, group = country, fill = as.factor(country), color = as.factor(country))) +
  geom_tile(aes(y = value/2,
                height = value,
                width = 0.9), alpha = 0.8, color = NA) +
  
  # text in x-axis (requires clip = "off" in coord_*)
  # paste(country, " ")  is a hack to make pretty spacing, since hjust > 1 
  #   leads to weird artifacts in text spacing.
  # This line for the numbers that tick up
  geom_text(aes(y = 0, label = paste(country, " ")), vjust = 0.2, hjust = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(y = value,
                label = as.factor(scales::percent(value, scale = 1, accuracy = 0.01))), 
            hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5 , nudge_y = 2) + #as.factor // , hjust = 0, nudge_y = 300
  coord_flip(clip = "off", expand = F) + #facet_wrap(~year)
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1, accuracy = 1), limits = c(0, 100)) +
  scale_x_reverse() +
  guides(color = "none", fill = "none") +
  labs(title = "Male labour force participation (15 years and older)",
       subtitle='{closest_state %>% as.numeric %>% floor()}', 
       x = "", y = "Labour force participation rate (%)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 20),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 15),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  # These relate to the axes post-flip
        axis.text.y  = element_blank(),  # These relate to the axes post-flip
        plot.margin = margin(1,1,1,4, "cm")) +
  transition_states(year, transition_length = 1, state_length = 0, wrap = FALSE) +
  enter_grow() +
  exit_shrink() +
  ease_aes('linear')

anim_save(here("en", "plot_male.gif"), animation = p_male, fps = 20, duration = 30, width = 800, height = 600, end_pause = 30)


```

Next, we can see that, during the first decade of the 2000s, Peru remains at the top of the table with around 85% male labour force participation. Countries such as Suriname and Guyana remain below 75% from 2000 onwards. It is worth noting that one of the countries with the greatest decline over the years was Venezuela, which went from 81% male labour force participation in 1990 to 68% in 2021.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here("en", "plot_male.gif"))
```


## Female labour force participation in South America

```{r}
#| eval: false

p_female <- 
  df_sa_female %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rank, group = country, fill = as.factor(country), color = as.factor(country))) +
  geom_tile(aes(y = value/2,
                height = value,
                width = 0.9), alpha = 0.8, color = NA) +
  
  # text in x-axis (requires clip = "off" in coord_*)
  # paste(country, " ")  is a hack to make pretty spacing, since hjust > 1 
  #   leads to weird artifacts in text spacing.
  # This line for the numbers that tick up
  geom_text(aes(y = 0, label = paste(country, " ")), vjust = 0.2, hjust = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(y = value,
                label = as.factor(scales::percent(value, scale = 1, accuracy = 0.01))), 
            hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5 , nudge_y = 2) + #as.factor // , hjust = 0, nudge_y = 300
  coord_flip(clip = "off", expand = F) + #facet_wrap(~year)
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1, accuracy = 1), limits = c(0, 100)) +
  scale_x_reverse() +
  guides(color = "none", fill = "none") +
  labs(title = "Female labour force participation (15 years and older)",
       subtitle='{closest_state %>% as.numeric %>% floor()}', 
       x = "", y = "Labour force participation rate (%)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 20),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 15),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  # These relate to the axes post-flip
        axis.text.y  = element_blank(),  # These relate to the axes post-flip
        plot.margin = margin(1,1,1,4, "cm")) +
  transition_states(year, transition_length = 1, state_length = 0, wrap = FALSE) +
  enter_grow() +
  exit_shrink() +
  ease_aes('linear')

anim_save(here("en", "plot_female.gif"), animation = p_female, fps = 20, duration = 30, width = 800, height = 600, end_pause = 30)

```

On the other hand, we can observe that in the case of women, labour participation does not usually exceed 70%. Exceptionally, Peru reached 73% in 2010. Likewise, the case of Bolivia stands out, which was at the forefront in the 1990s with approximately 59% female labour participation, and which by 2021 ended up with 69% participation. In contrast, Chile maintained values between 30%-50% between 1990 and 2021.

```

## Conclusion

Finally, we can conclude that although male labour force participation is higher than female participation, we can observe a greater dynamism in the increase of female participation between 1990 and 2021, with some countries, such as Peru, increasing their participation by approximately 30% during this period.
